node_module\*.js 
node_module\*.json


 This is a very common pattern in Node.js projects. The `node_modules` folder is not included in the project by default, but you can add it to the project by right-clicking on the project in the Solution Explorer and selecting **Add > Existing Folder...**. Select the `node_modules` folder to add it to the project.
